Smart Medico : AI Based Medicine Suggestions to Patients and Smart Contract Enforceable Payment Delivery.

Problem : Patient goes to doctor to get solution of his disease.
Patient ends up getting few suggestions and medicines and a bill which he needs to pay upfront either he is cured or disease.

1. Now Machine can suggest medicine to customer based on his symptoms.
2. Doctor Approves/Disapproves the suggested medicines.
3. Doctor gets paid when the customer is well enforced by ETH Smart contracts.

Now : First Machine will suggest which medicines patient can take approved by "doctor" as a prescription (legal one) and customer does not have to pay upfront although doctor gets a reputation based on that and patient gets cured doctor gets his fees enforced by Smart Contract on a public chain and patient only pays for the medicines delivered at home.

If Doctor DisApproves the Medicines suggested by machine then doctor can write his own medicine and machine will record that and will be recorded on the Public Chain and thus patient gets well and then payment gets paid using smart cotracts to doctor if not the reverse will follow.

Easy.

Legal Prescription on Public Chain
Patient at Ease No Upfront Money.
Only Prescription Charges.
Doctor Charged If Disapproves the Case.
No Visit to Doctor.
Patient Happy.

Thanks.
